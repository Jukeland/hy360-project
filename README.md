# hy360-project

================================================================

The project was created and runs in Apache NetBeans IDE 19.

The server used is Apache Tomcat 9.0.82 but it probably
runs in later versions of Tomcat as well.

The project also requires the XAMPP Control Panel to serve
as the database. Enable Apache and MySQL.

Add the Apache Tomcat files in the Services\Servers of NetBeans, 
open the project files as a Project on Netbeans
and run it using (F6) or by clicking the Run button on the
top bar. After running the Project through NetBeans, the
Tomcat Module of XAMPP should be enabled and the webpage
should be visible on your browser.
